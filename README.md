# Analysis of Video Game Reviews Dataset

## Introduction
Video games have become a significant form of entertainment, influencing both childhoods and adult lives. The rise of digital distribution platforms, particularly Steam, has transformed gaming into a global phenomenon, providing not only games but also community features that connect players.

## Project Context
As data scientists, our mission is to analyze the pool of game reviews on Steam. Each entry in our dataset corresponds to a unique player-game interaction, offering insights into user experiences.

## Objectives
In this project, we will address several research questions (RQs) related to the dataset. These questions will be explored and answered in the [main.ipynb] file:

* [RQ1] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the dataset's structure and key features.
* [RQ2] Review Distribution: Analyze the distribution of reviews, identify top applications, and examine user recommendations.
* [RQ3] Review Activity Trends: Investigate monthly review submissions, seasonal patterns, and peak engagement times.
* [RQ4] User Experience and Ratings: Analyze the relationship between user time spent on applications and review scores.
* [RQ5] Top Reviewers: Identify top reviewers and their habits, including review helpfulness.
* [RQ6] Language Behavior: Compare review behaviors between English and Spanish speakers.
* [RQ7] Statistical Analysis: Calculate probabilities related to helpful votes and validate hypotheses.
* Bonus Analysis - Sentiment Analysis
* Algorithm question
   
## Conclusion
This analysis aims to uncover important patterns in the dataset, informing development strategies and enhancing player experiences in the gaming community.
